- 👋 Hi, I’m @ataraxyarcane but this is an alt account. (Yes an alt account on GitHub. Like a finsta but... on GitHub. A Fithub, if you will. No, that sounds too similar to another Hub... but so does GitHub so eh.)
- 👀 I’m interested in ... too many things at once.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... C#, JavaScript, Prolog, Python, C and C++. I have do modules on all of those so they're going in here alright.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing yet, I don't think my skills are strong enough for that just yet
- 📫 How to reach me ... don't. This should be the best preventor.
